BigMHC Academic License

This license agreement (“License”) is made by and between you (“Licensee”) and the Karchin Lab of the Johns Hopkins University ("Licensor"), and concerns software known as “BigMHC” for the prediction of MHC-I epitope and neoepitope presentation and immunogenicity. BigMHC is comprised of executable code and binaries, source code, and documentation, collectively referred to as the “Software”.
“Work based on the Software” means either the Software or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Software or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term “modification”.)
“Using the Software” means any act of creating executables that contain or directly use libraries that are part of the Software, running any of the tools that are part of the Software, or creating works based on the Software.
§1. A non-exclusive, non-transferable license is granted to the Licensee to use the Software free of charge for any noncommercial purpose, including teaching and research at universities, colleges and other educational institutions, research at non-profit research institutions, and personal non-profit purposes. For using the Software for commercial purposes, including but not limited to consulting activities, design of commercial hardware or software networking products, and a commercial entity participating in research projects, the Licensee must contact the Licensor for an appropriate license.
§2. Nothing contained in this license is to be interpreted to affect any intellectual property rights associated with the software or any other agreements or commercial licenses of the software. No assignment is being made to any exclusive use of the software or any transfer of ownership rights of an intellectual property associated with the software.
§3. The Licensee may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Software source code and documentation as the Licensee receives it, in any medium, provided that the Licensee (a) conspicuously and appropriately publishes on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty, and (b) keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty, and (c) and give any other recipients of the Software a copy of this License along with the Software.
§4. The Licensee may modify copies of the Software or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Software, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 3 above, provided that the Licensee also meet all of these conditions:
a) The Licensee must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating: that the Licensee changed the files, the dates of when each change was made, and a description of each change.
b) The Licensee must cause any work that the Licensee distributes or publishes, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Software or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
§5. The Licensee may copy and distribute the Software (or a work based on it, under Section 4) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 3 and 4 above provided that the Licensee also accompanies it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 3 and 4 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
§6. The Licensee may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Software except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Software is void, and will automatically terminate the Licensee’s rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from the Licensee under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
§7. By copying, modifying, or distributing the Software (or any work based on the Software), the Licensee indicates acceptance of this License and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Software or works based on it, to do so.
§8. Each time the Licensee redistributes the Software (or any work based on the Software), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, or modify the Software subject to these terms and conditions. The Licensee may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients’ exercise of the rights granted herein. The Licensee is not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
§9. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on the Licensee (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse the Licensee from the conditions of this License. If the Licensee cannot simultaneously satisfy obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence the Licensee may not may not copy, modify, or distribute the Software at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Software by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through the Licensee, then the only way the Licensee could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Software.
§10. If distribution and/or use of the Software are restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Software under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
§11. This License shall be governed by the laws of the State of Maryland, excluding the application of its conflicts of law rules. Licensee agrees that any dispute shall be appropriate only in the state and federal courts located within the State of Maryland. Any provision that is contrary to the laws of Maryland shall be stricken as if it was not included in the license, but that all other provisions remain enforceable.
NO WARRANTY
§12. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHERE OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH THE LICENSEE. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, THE LICENSEE ASSUMES THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
§13. IN NO EVENT, UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED ON IN WRITING, WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO THE LICENSEE FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY THE LICENSEE OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
